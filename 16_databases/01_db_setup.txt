Welcome to Northbakers! üç∞

We've decided Data Engineering isn't for us anymore, and we're all leaving to become bakers.

Help us! 

First of all, you'll need the notes: [LINK TO NOTES]

Next, you'll need to do a bit of setup:

1. In your terminal, create your first database. It should be called `northbakers`.

2. Make a table called 'bakers'. It should have the following columns:
- baker_id: integer (primary key)
- baker_name: text (not null)
- bakery: text

3. Insert data into the 'bakers' table. 
Hint: the data you're looking for is in data/bakers.txt in this repo!

*If you ever accidentally leave the sqlite3 repl, don't panic! You can reopen it using the `sqlite3` command and then use the command `.open northbakers.db` to reconnect to the database.
